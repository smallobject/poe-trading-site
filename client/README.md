# Client Side

You don't need to run the client side separately unless you really have to since nothing will work without connecting to the backend.

# Stack

- React
- Redux & redux-thunk
- TailwindCSS
- PostCSS

# TailwindCSS

This uses the newest available version of TailwindCSS available but it does not include TailwindCSs-JIT, although WindiCSS might be a better alternative.

# Run the project

If you really need to only run the front-end then do

```
npm start
```
