# Server Side

To run the project I decided to add the concurrently code inside the server. Since I was mostly messing around with the backend trying to figure out how the API worked, you will notice a lot of test routes, pay no attention :).. or do if you're interested as well.

# Stack

- NodeJS + Express
- PoE API

# Run the project

Make sure you're in the server directory and run the following code

```
npm run dev
```
